    <p>Hi there! 👋</p>
    <p>I'm a PhD candidate and AI researcher passionate about using Generative AI to create solutions that matter.</p>
    <p>At Amazon Web Services, I work with governments and institutions to design innovation strategies powered by AI and cloud.</p>
    <p>My journey has taken me through innovation teams at Telefónica, Lenovo, and Microsoft, where I learned the value of driving change with purpose.</p>

## What I Do

I explore how generative models are reshaping education, policy, and the future of work. Beyond research, you'll usually find me 🚴 cycling around Madrid, 🌍 discovering new cities, or 🎙️ sharing ideas on how AI and technology can transform the way we learn and live.
