**Trae.ai** is a free, AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE) created by **ByteDance** (the company behind TikTok). Its goal is to act as a real-time **AI coding assistant** built into the editor, helping developers write, understand, and automate code.

- Built on a customized version of **VS Code**.
- Offers **context-aware suggestions**, autocomplete, and code correction.
- Includes a **"Builder" mode** that generates entire projects from natural language descriptions.
- Supports **VS Code extensions and Git**.
- Available for **Windows and macOS** (Linux support not yet available).
- Interface in English and Simplified Chinese.

## Why was it launched?

Trae.ai addresses two key problems:

1. The need to **speed up coding** using AI.
2. The **high cost** of similar tools (e.g., Copilot, Cursor).

ByteDance launched Trae as a **completely free and unlimited tool**, aiming to democratize AI-assisted coding and compete in this fast-growing space.

## Differences from *Vibe Coding*

| Aspect               | Vibe Coding                                     | Trae.ai                                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| What is it?          | A method of coding by idea                      | A real tool implementing that method             |
| Usage mode           | Chatbot (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude)                 | Full IDE with built-in AI                        |
| Integration          | External to code editor                         | Internal, part of the IDE                        |
| Automation           | Manual, iterative                               | Can build full projects instantly                |
| Code awareness       | Context must be provided manually               | AI sees and understands full project context     |

Trae.ai takes *vibe coding* to the next level by embedding the AI assistant directly into the coding workflow, with full contextual awareness and smart editing capabilities.

## What AI powers Trae.ai?

Trae.ai uses some of the most advanced language models:

- **Claude 3.5 and 3.7** (Anthropic) – optimized for code.
- **GPT-4** (OpenAI).
- **DeepSeek** – open-source models.

All of this is available **without API setup or extra costs**. The AI can:

- Understand natural language queries.
- Analyze and generate high-quality code.
- Refactor functions or entire files.
- Provide inline help and explanations.

## How is it free?

ByteDance is **subsidizing** Trae.ai, focusing on user acquisition and market disruption rather than monetization (for now). Their goals:

- Build a **large user base**.
- Offer a **free alternative** to expensive AI coding tools.
- Explore **future monetization options** once adoption is high.

Currently, Trae.ai is:

- **100% free** – no subscriptions, no usage limits.
- Fully featured.
- In active development.

## Comparison: Trae.ai vs. Other Tools

| Tool             | Main Purpose                     | AI Used                            | Key Features                                                  | Pricing                  | Ease of Use                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Trae.ai**      | Full IDE with integrated AI      | Claude 3.5/3.7, GPT-4, DeepSeek     | Context-aware chat, autocomplete, Builder mode, Git, agents    | **Free & unlimited**     | High – familiar for VS Code users           |
| **ChatGPT**      | General-purpose AI chatbot       | GPT-3.5 (Free), GPT-4 (Plus)        | Code generation via chat, no direct project integration        | Freemium ($20/mo for GPT-4) | High – very accessible, but outside IDE      |
| **Notion AI**    | Writing/productivity assistant   | GPT-4, Claude                       | Writing, summaries, brainstorming (not code-focused)           | $10/mo AI add-on         | High for Notion users                       |
| **Vibe Coding**  | Development *method* (not a tool)| Varies (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)        | Conversational code generation, manual integration             | Depends on tools used     | Medium – flexible but requires manual setup |
